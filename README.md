# Word Prediction Model

This project is a basic machine learning model for predicting the next word in a sequence using a pre-trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. It implements Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques.

## Project Structure

- **trainer.py**: This file contains the code for training the LSTM model using the pre-processed text data.
- **predictor.py**: This file contains the code for making predictions based on the trained LSTM model.
- **metamorphosis_clean.txt**: This is the cleaned and pre-processed text file used as a sample input for training the model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need the following Python packages:
- TensorFlow or Keras (for building and training the LSTM model)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- pandas (for data handling and manipulation)

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas
